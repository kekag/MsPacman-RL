# Ms. Pacman Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning on the Atari 2600 game Ms. Pac-Man using a CNN with Tensorflow and OpenAI's gym environment.

Note: this uses the **[keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard)** library, which on linux requires root permissions for full functionality. When installing the dependencies and launching the program, be sure to run with sudo permissions. Or just run `make install` and `make run` with the included Makefile.

`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt && sudo python3 MsPacman.py`
